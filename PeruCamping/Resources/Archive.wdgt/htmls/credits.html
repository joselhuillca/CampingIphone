The entire team at Northern World Entertainment Software Inc., sincerely thanks you for the purchase of our graphic comic offering. <br>
Please note, that we have endeavored to bring a new medium of entertainment to portray the rise of the Islamic Golden Ages to you. This period of history was not a particularly glorious time for the early adopters of Islamic ideology and the period is also known as the time of ignorance. While every effort has been made to ensure historical accuracy, we ask for your forgiveness if there is anything you disagree with or find to be incorrect. We have strived to maintain accuracy of our narratives through authentic hadith and Quranic sources. <br>
Please note that there is no attempt in any way to portray the Prophet Muhammad (saw) as we respect his wishes to not be portrayed or drawn in any manner. You will however, find script and narrative that is in line with authentic hadith and occasionally paraphrased to the best of our abilities to accommodate the transliterated language.<br> 
We sincerely hope that you enjoy our attempt to bring to you… Beyond Badr : Episode 0 <br>
Beyond Badr : Episode 0, May 2016. Published by Northern World Entertainment Software Inc.
