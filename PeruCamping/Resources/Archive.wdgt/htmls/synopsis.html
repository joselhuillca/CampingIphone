Synopsis 
</span>
<br> <br> 
The Battle of Badr took place on the 17th of Ramadhan, 2 Hijri or 624 CE.<br> 
This was the first official battle of the early Muslims, the followers of the Islamic ideology. After a significant period of oppression and ruthless aggression against the early Muslims, our story begins with the events of Badr and our humble efforts to portray the rise of the Islamic Golden Ages. <br>
This battle is mentioned in the divine Quran and accounted through authentic hadith. There are numerous lessons for the Ummah, believers of the messages of Prophet Muhammad (saw) and for all of mankind, and on this day several miracles were witnessed on the battle field that are attributed to Allah's (swt) divine intervention. We have made every attempt to portray this epic event with accuracy and to the best of our abilities, however, we make no attempt to claim that this is a perfect account! As such we apologize for any inaccuracies or errors contained within and confirm any errors are solely from us as human beings and not in any way attributed to Prophet Muhammad (SAW) or Allah (SWT). <br>
<strong>Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala (SWT)</strong> is one of the highest names that God attributes to Himself in Islam and can also be found in religious scriptures written in Aramaic and Hebrew languages also referring to God. For context of our narrative we use Allah (SWT) as the one and only deity worthy of being worshipped and deserving of being worshipped due to the perfect godly attributes in which He is described.<br> 
<strong>Muhammad Salallahu Alaihi Wa Salam (SAW),</strong>  is known in Islam as the last Prophet to be sent to mankind. He is also known as the Prophet of Mercy. The Prophet's narratives are transliterations and in no way worthy representations of his actual speech to mankind, however we believe that we have maintained the crux of his teachings in our very humble efforts. <br>
<strong>Sahabah</strong><br>
These are the earliest of Muslim's who accept the ideology that there is only One God worthy of worship, Allah (swt) and that Muhammad (saw) is his last messenger and prophet. لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله Lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāh, Muḥammadur-rasūlu-llāh is the shahadah or testimony that a Muslim makes in order to become a believer. This is done in a state of purity (cleanliness) with a sane witness and or a religious leader present.   
<br> <br>
<strong>Quraish</strong><br>
The Quraish were a power merchant tribe that controlled the lands of Mecca and the Ka'bah during the time of Prophet Muhammad (saw) who was of the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraish tribe. <br>
The tribal leaders during the times of Prophet Muhammad (saw) viewed him as a significant threat to their livelihood and sought to end his life many times. <br>
The linguistic origin of Quraish means to gather people from great distances. When asked why they are called Quraish, Ibn Abbas (RA) replied, "They are like the beast in the ocean that eats but is not eaten, it over powers and it is not over powered, that's what Quraish are".  <br>
Allah (swt) sent a gift to the Quraish and a stern warning as mentioned in Surah 106 of the Holy Quran.
