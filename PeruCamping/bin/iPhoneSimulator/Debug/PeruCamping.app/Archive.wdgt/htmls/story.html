 The Story 
 </span> 
<br> <br> 
The Battle of Badr took place on the 17th of Ramadhan, 2 Hijri or 624 CE. <br> 
This was the first official battle of the early Muslims, the followers of the Islamic ideology. After a significant period of oppression and ruthless aggression against the early Muslims, our story begins with the events of Badr and our humble efforts to portray the rise of the Islamic Golden Ages. <br> 
This battle is mentioned in the divine Quran and accounted through authentic hadith. There are numerous lessons for the Ummah, believers of the messages of Prophet Muhammad (saw) and for all of mankind, and on this day several miracles were witnessed on the battle field that are attributed to Allah's (swt) divine intervention. We have made every attempt to portray this epic event with accuracy and to the best of our abilities, however, we make no attempt to claim that this is a perfect account! As such we apologize for any inaccuracies or errors contained within and confirm any errors are solely from us as human beings and not in any way attributed to Prophet Muhammad (SAW) or Allah (SWT).
